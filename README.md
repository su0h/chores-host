# Chores
**Chores** is a chore-tracking full-stack web application that I built solely for *practice* (and potentially for personal household use). It simply displays the chore assignments for the day with the help of both Spring Boot and Angular. This repository contains the *backend* aspect of this project (proceed [here](https://www.github.com/su0h/chores-web) for the *frontend* repository).

## ...but why?
For context, there are three (3) of us who are sharing the chore workload here at home. Each person normally has one task to do at a time, and the task assignment "shifts" on a daily basis to rotate the tasks among us (twice if it is a weekend or a holiday). 

More often than not, everyone here in the household is unable to keep track of the task assignments for the day. *Quite weird if you think of it.* Every evening, someone would be asking "Sino hain?" *Who will prepare the dining table?* "Sino ligpit?" *Who will clean up the dining table?* "Sino hugas?" *Who will wash the dishes?*. 

I have to admit, sometimes the pestering can become quite tedious and annoying personally - especially when one of the assignees is busy working. With this, as a part of my personal desire to automate as many things as possible here at home, I have decided to work on **Chores**.

*P.S. I decided to add a Spring Boot backend because I needed to keep track of the current state of task assignments, and I also needed to keep track of when to shift once or twice (or even undo a shift when no chores were done for a certain schedule). I simply could not make this work with an Angular frontend alone.*
